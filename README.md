# bi0s_Meetup

- This repository contains the slides and scripts accompanying the sessions.
- I have also included my JADX Markings used for the malicious payload. 

Password for the sample: `infected`. 

Note: Do not run the application in real devices as some of its features are still functional.

Reference link to [Kavanoz](https://github.com/eybisi/kavanoz) as it is highly beneficial to unpack Android Banking Trojans.

Thank You :)
